# Introduction:
This is a small renderer I developed through the journey of learning Computer Graphics. Currently there's no specific purpose except experimenting grapchics algorithms in which I'm interested. So, as one may expect, it's a Hodgepodge with various "food" in different quality.

The **ongoing project** is Volumetric Real-time Cloud for my master dissertation in Newcastle University, UK.



# Current features:
### Particle system
### Particle System Update: Particle System now supports texture atlas
