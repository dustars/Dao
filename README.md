# Introduction:
A small renderer I developed through the journey of learning Computer Graphics. Currently there's no specific purpose except experimenting grapchics algorithms. So, in a sense, it's just a Hodgepodge with various "food" in different quality.

**Update 7/17/2020**

To make project well-organized and clean, all dependencies will be removed to [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg), which is a very convenient tool to manage C and C++ libraires cross-platform.


The **ongoing project** is Volumetric Real-time Cloud for my master dissertation in Newcastle University, UK.
